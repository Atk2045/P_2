# P_2
# Football status scraper

In this code, we scrape [https://fbref.com](https://fbref.com), which contains match logs, team and player status of major football leagues. We will be specifically outlining the players abilities on average from both teams and see if there was a hint on who would win or lose. 

# Website used

We used [https://fbref.com](https://fbref.com) because it was accessible using our Beautifulsoup web scraping. Although we tried ESPN, it blocked our request to scrape. 

#Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

BeautifulSoup4: For parsing HTML and XML documents.
